          <p>Welcome to my world! I'm just your vertically-challenged, 20-year-old dork who enjoys coding,
            drumming, and watching Netflix. If I'm not doing any of those things, I'm probably stuffing
            my face with chinese food, or napping.
          </p>
          <p>I spend a good amount of my week with the Spartan Marching Band playing the snare drum
            (I promise I am taller than I look in that first picture). Football games are a ton of fun and
            I've made some of my best friends in band.
          </p>
          <p>As I start the second half of my undergrad here at MSU, I've made some pretty awesome friends.
            I can't imagine spending countless hours in the engineering building without the friends I've
            made so far. Shout out to Madeline (second one in second picture) for being my rock and keeping
            me going even when I feel like dropping out of school and becoming a yoga teacher.
          </p>

            Thanks for stopping by! Have a good day :)

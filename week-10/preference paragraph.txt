	I felt that the style tiles helped me organize my general design ideas and will give me a good reference as I continue with the design process. I am glad that I started with creating the style tiles before building my final comp. I think if I had gone right into creating the mockup, I wouldn’t have had a solid foundation to base my design ideas from. As far as time spent working on both the tiles and the comp, I think I spent about a half hour on each, which isn’t that long. While I think it would have been possible to go straight into creating a full comp, I’m glad I took the time to form two style tiles to aid my development of the mockup.

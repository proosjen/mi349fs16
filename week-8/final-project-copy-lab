about me page
  - my name is Jenn Proos and I'm a junior at Michigan State University studying
  computer science. since I was little, I've loved building things from scratch
  solving brain-twisting puzzles. Combining my passion for front and back-end
  technologies, I hope to become a full-stack developer.
  - I decided to study computer science because you can look at each project as if
  it were puzzle. We are given the pieces to come to a solution, however it is up
  to us to figure out how to put the pieces together.
  - at the end of the day, my end goal is to apply my skills towards an application
  that will make someone's life easier. whether it's to improve the look and feel
  of a web page or to build an application, I hope to use my passions towards the
  most optimal product I can possible create.
